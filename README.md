# Hashtable CS32
Implemented a hash table to increase efficiency of a compiler(compiles a 200K line code written in a very simple language that declares variables and uses scopes).

Hash Table implementation is done in NameTable.cpp, decreases compilation time from around 800 ms to around 50 ms, by using a more efficient data structure and using the most efficient hashing algorithm.
